    <p>
      Clapton Country Club is a 1 minute walk away from Clapton Overground Station. From here you can travel south to Liverpool St station or north to Walthamstow Central to connect to multiple tube lines. Please note however that the last train to Liverpool St is approximately 11.30pm.
    </p>
    <p>
      A taxi would be the easiest way home for most guests. We recommend that downloading Uber as this will be the easiest way to organise a taxi home on the night!
